iii).Scalability – Helps build systems that can grow with increasing users and data.
iv). Security – Implements secure coding practices to prevent cyber threats that have become a big threat in the world.
v). Cost-Effective Maintenance – Well-engineered software is very easy to update and maintain.
vi). Enables Innovation – Facilitates the creation of new technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud computing.
vii). Drives Business Growth – Businesses globally rely on software for automation, data management, and customer interactions.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term software engineering was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968.
This was in response to the "Software Crisis", where large software projects were failing due to poor planning, high costs, and unreliability.
This led to the development of structured programming and systematic methodologies.

2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – 1980s
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, improving code reusability and maintainability.
Languages like C++, Java, and Python were developed, making software design more modular and scalable. OOP became the foundation for modern software development.

3. The Agile Revolution (2001 – Present)
The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced Agile methodologies to replace rigid, traditional models like the Waterfall method. It emphasized flexibility, iterative development, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, and maintain software efficiently. It consists of the following phases:
1. Planning
Defines project scope, objectives, and feasibility. It involves resource allocation, cost estimation, and risk analysis.
2. Requirement Analysis
It gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements thus this ensures clarity on what the software should achieve.
3. Design
It creates architecture, database structure, and user interface (UI) design. This includes High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) for system components.
4. Implementation (Coding)
The developers write code based on design specifications. Follows coding standards, best practices, and version control.
5. Testing
Identifies and fixes bugs through unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT). This ensures software meets requirements and functions correctly.
6. Deployment
Software is released to production for end-users. This may involve phased rollout, beta testing, or direct deployment.
7. Maintenance & Support
This fixes bugs, improves performance, and updates features based on user feedback. It ensures software remains secure, scalable, and functional over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
APPROACH: Waterfall methodology is linear and sequential while Agile methodology is iterative and incremental.
FLEXIBILITY: Waterfall methodology is rigid and changes are difficult to make while Agile methodology is highly flexible, accommodates changes easily.
PHASES: Waterfall methodology has defined stages while Agile methodology has continuous cycles of planning, designing, developing and testing.
CUSTOMER INVOLVEMENT:Waterfall methodology has minimal involvement after requirement gathering while Agile methodology has continuous involvement and feedback.
DELIVERY: Waterfall methodology is delivered as a whole at the end of the project while Agile methodology is delivered in small increments, ensuring quick results.
DOCUMENTATION: Waterfall methodology has extensive documentation before development begins while Agile methodology has minimal documentation, with a focus on working software.
Waterfall methodology is useful during:
1.	Construction Projects – A building's blueprint must be completed before construction starts. Any changes after construction begins are costly and difficult to implement.
2.	Medical Device Development – Requires strict regulatory compliance, detailed documentation, and thorough testing before release.
3.	Government Projects – Often have fixed budgets, strict regulations, and detailed requirements.
4.	ERP System Implementation – Requires careful planning and structured deployment without frequent changes.
Agile methodology is useful during:
1.	Software Startups – A mobile app startup iterating on features based on user feedback.
2.	E-commerce Website Development – Frequent updates and changes based on market trends and user behavior.
3.	Marketing Campaigns – Agile allows rapid adjustments based on customer response and analytics.
4.	AI and Machine Learning Projects – Continuous learning and refinement based on real-time data.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
An IDE is a software application that provides developers with comprehensive tools to write, debug, and test code efficiently in one unified interface.
Importance of IDEs in Software Development
✅ Code Efficiency & Productivity – IDEs offer features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools, which help developers write code faster and with fewer errors.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts (input queries or instructions) to optimize the responses generated by AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini. It involves crafting structured and specific instructions to guide AI towards producing precise, relevant, and useful outputs.
________________________________________
Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interactions
Enhances AI Response Quality – Well-structured prompts result in more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
Improves Efficiency – A clear and direct prompt reduces the need for follow-up clarifications, saving time.

Controls Output Style & Tone – By adjusting the wording, a prompt can influence the AI's response style (formal, casual, technical, etc.).

Boosts Creativity & Innovation – AI can generate unique ideas, solutions, and content based on how a prompt is framed.

Optimizes AI for Specific Tasks – Helps fine-tune AI for coding, writing, data analysis, customer support, and more.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt
Explain AI.

Specific and Guided Prompt
"Explain artificial intelligence in simple terms, focusing on its impact on daily life." 

A specific and guided prompt improves AI responses by providing clarity, context, and constraints, leading to better accuracy, relevance, and efficiency. Better and guided prompts are more effective because they reduce ambiguity, improves accuracy and relevance, enhances efficiency and encourages AI creativity and problem solving.
